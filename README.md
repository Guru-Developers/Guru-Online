# Guru Online

The following is our website linked to Heroku. Note any commits made to the master branch are automatically designed to update
the corresponding [website](guru-apps.heroku.com). Once we have something along, we can potentially switch over to
[Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com).

For information on the repo as is, make sure to look at the [template](https://github.com/Guru-Developers/Ruby-On-Rails-4.2-Template).

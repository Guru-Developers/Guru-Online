                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                We are a team of software developers based out of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Being at a liberal arts school, our founders, Morgan Howell and Joshua Potter, recognized the need for technological support and assistance for other campus departments and clubs as well as local start-ups.  Guru Solutions was created to meet this need.  We are a hardworking group of individuals eager to utilize our knowledge to catalyze ideas in our community as well as accelerate our own ideas throughout campus.

                    <p>We love what we do. We are eager to tackle problems and come up with creative and innovative solutions. We may be young, but years of experience can't make up for the enthusiam, creative energy and dedication we will put toward any project set in front of us.</p>

                    <h3>Different</h3>
                    <p>As students, we are actively involved with many different aspects of computer science. By having teammates who are well rounded instead of specializing in different areas, we are able to take a more holistic approach to problems. We thoroughly consider all solutions and select the one that is the best fit for the company.</p>

                    <h3>Creative</h3>
                    <p>Though we all major in computer science, we also all have at least one other major or minor in a different field. This adds diversity to our thought processees, helping us to develope unique and effective solutions to any problems.</p>
